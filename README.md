Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure. Construction differs from manufacturing. Manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client. Construction is directly tied to the fields of civil engineering and architecture. A construction company is responsible for building structures in the commercial and private sectors. In simple words, we can say that a construction company is a type of business, enterprise, or similar organization created and operating to construct a wide variety of buildings, developments, housing, path, pavement, roads, motorways, and other types of construction projects. A construction company involves lot of parameters like details of projects, employees, machineries and raw materials.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82011786/235124514-3c74a7cb-4c05-4ff7-ba3f-1dc7eba6ffec.png)
